    <ul>
        
        <li> 2 brioche buns (any bun would do) </li>
        <li> 2 beef patties (don't know the proportions; 
        just needs to be fresh ground beef) </li>
        <li> Extra Virgin Olive Oil (any type of oil 
        would do) </li>
        <li> Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li> Butter </li>
        <li> A packet of American/Cheddar cheese </li>
        <li> Ketchup </li>
        <li> Mayo </li>
        <li> Hot sauce </li>
        <li> Relish </li>
        <li> 1 Onion </li>

    </ul>

    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Heat up a pan to high heat </li>
        <li> While the pan is being heated, take 
        your beef patties and season them generously with 
        salt and pepper on both sides </li>
        <li> Pour the oil onto the pan and place 
        both patties on top of the pan on one side (sepearate obviously) </li>
        <li> Wait for about a minute till the bottom gets cooked </li>
        <li> While waiting, cut up a few thin slices of onion and 
        cook them in a seperate hot pan with a few slices of butter 
        till caramelized. </li>
        <li> Once the patties are done cooking on one side, flip them
        and place two slices of cheese on top of each patty and wait till they're
        melted </li>
        <li> While the patties cook, take the onions out and toast the 
        insides of each bun slice with the remaining butter.  </li>
        <li> In the meantime, take 2 tbsp of ketchup and mayo,
        a teaspoon of hot sauce and 1/2 tbsp of relish to make
        the special sauce </li>
        <li> Once everything is done cooking, assemble the burger in 
        the following manner: <ol>
            <li> Spread a touch of the special sauce on the base
            of each bun slice
            </li>
            <li> Add the patty on top of the base bun </li>
            <li> Top the patty with the onion </li>
            <li> Complete the burger with the bun top on top </li>
        </ol> </li>
