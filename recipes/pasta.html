    <h2> Description </h2>

    <p> <strong> <em> The greatest pasta recipe known to mankind! 
    This would even make top chefs jealous! </em></strong> </p>

    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Pasta (Preferrably Penne or Spaghetti
        , but any type would do) </li>
        <li> Olive Oil </li>
        <li> Chicken Breast (how much ever you need) </li>
        <li> 1 - 2 cans of tomato sauce </li>
        <li> 1 - 2 packets of whole cooking cream</li>
        <li> Cajun Spice Powder </li>
        <li> Tomatoes </li>
        <li> Red and Green Peppers </li>
        <li> Enough water to fill a pot </li>
        <li> Salt </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Fill a pot with water and bring it to a boil </li>
        <li> Whist the water boils, cut up the chicken into small pieces
        and spread the cajun mixture over it </li>
        <li> Next, cut up the tomatoes and peppers into small chunks </li>
        <li> Then, heat up a pan to high heat and pour oil in it </li>
        <li> By this time, the water will be boiling. Add the pasta into the
        boiling water and set a timer for 8 minutes (or till the pasta becomes aldente) </li>
        <li> Sprinkle a lot of salt onto the boiling water </li>
        <li> Whilst the pasta gets cooked, add the chicken into
        the pan and stir till cooked </li>
        <li> Once the chicken is done, add the veggies 
        and stir for about a minute </li>
        <li> Then add the sauces (tomato and cream) into the pan 
        and mix in low heat</li>
        <li> By this time, the pasta must be ready. Before straining the pasta,
        add some pasta water to the sauce so that it doesn't get too thick </li>
        <li> Strain the pasta and add it to the sauce </li>
        <li> Mix for a few minutes before it is ready to serve </li>
    </ol>
    <p> <strong><em> Now you are ready to feast upon this creamy heaven! </em></strong>  </p>
    <p><em>Make sure that the pasta is properly salted 
    and cooked before eating! </em></p>
